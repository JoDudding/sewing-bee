This week we're looking at The Great British Sewing Bee (GBSB).

The Great British Sewing Bee is a BBC reality show that has talented amateur sewers 
compete to be named "Britain's best home sewer". 
Data about the show has been sourced from Wikipedia.

> present a global species-level compilation of key functional traits for palms 
> (Arecaceae), a plant family with keystone importance in tropical and 
> subtropical ecosystems.
-->

> The show format is similar to The Great British Bake Off in that each episode 
> features three challenges within an overall theme. The series starts with 10 amateur 
> sewers, with the weakest eliminated each episode. In the Pattern Challenge, the 
> judges give them the same pattern, which they must follow as accurately as possible. 
> In the Transformation Challenge, existing garments or fabrics of a similar form, 
> picked from a rail provided by the programme, or sourced by the contestants 
> themselves, are reinvented by the sewers as a specified different type of garment. 
> In the third Made-to-measure Challenge, the sewers design and create their own 
> garments, and must adjust their patterns to fit human models.

Optional: Add questions that users should try to answer. For example:
- How does the sizes of the different species of palms vary across sub families?
- Which fruit colors occur most often?
-->

- How have viewership numbers changed across series?
- Does sewer performance in the first four weeks indicate who the series winner will be?
